This api is created for the interview of Randstad and aimed to upload data from a flat file (product_data.csv) to database.

Functions
1. I used spring boot to create this application, which includes both backend and frontend.
2. I created a table named product, including information of product.
3. At the backend, I made a 'Product' object that includes product_id and product_name, same as the columns of table.
   I made a batch class, which has three main functions, including reader, processor and writer.
   Those methods are used for reading data from database, processing the data on purpose and writing data to the table.
4. At the front end, I created a simple AngularJS file and a html file for mocking the user's interface.

Thank you!
